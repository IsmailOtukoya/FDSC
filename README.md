## Task: 
We need to predict the medical charges for an insurance company using Linear regression. A dataset called insurance is provided.

a. Find the summary statistics of the variable charges in the dataset

b. Display a table that contains the number of people in each region

c. Visualize the relationship among all features using a scatterplot matrix

d. Train a model on the data

e. Evaluate the model performance

f. Improve the model performance by Adding nonlinear relationship (Hint
consider only age as input)

Since smoking and obesity may have a harmful impact, we assume the
combination of the two may be worse. Build a model with the interaction effects of smokers and obesity (Obesity is considered for BMI >30)

Improve your regression model by putting a, and b together
